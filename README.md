# Snippable Dictionary
English dictionary of 176000+ words, compiled into csv format with attributes - (word, type, meaning)

The data in csv format was taken from the following website:
https://www.bragitoff.com/2016/03/english-dictionary-in-csv-format/


compile.py file is used to read all csv file of all words from A-Z in the
Dictionary-in-csv folder and processes/ string operates to seperate words,
word-type and meaning, appends all 176000+ entries in a single 
english_dictionary.csv file. 

I found almost no online resource which gave a full list of english 
dictionary words in csv format.

I wish to add more attributes such as - useage, etymology, synonymns/ antonyms for the same.

Please refer to compile.py if you wish to contribute to the project.
